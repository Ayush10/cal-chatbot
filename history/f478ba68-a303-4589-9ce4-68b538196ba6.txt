[2025-05-18T19:16:44-07:00] [assistant]: It seems like you want to create a booking. To proceed, I'll need a bit more information:

1. **Type of event**: What is the title and description of this event?
2. **Length of the event**: How long will it last (in minutes)?
3. **Attendee information**: Who will join the meeting? Please provide their name and email address.
4. **Date and Time**: When do you want to schedule the event? Please provide potential dates and times.

Once I have this information, I can assist you further in creating the booking.
