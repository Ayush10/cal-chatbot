[2025-05-18T19:16:36-07:00] [assistant]: I can help with a variety of tasks involving managing and scheduling events or meetings. Hereâ€™s a list of some specific things I can assist with:

1. **Scheduling Meetings**: I can book meetings or events based on available time slots.
2. **Listing Events**: I can list all your scheduled events or filter them by specific criteria.
3. **Canceling Events**: If you need to cancel a scheduled event, I can handle that.
4. **Rescheduling Events**: I can help you change the timing of an existing event.
5. **Checking Availability**: I can check available time slots for a specific event type, making it easier for you to plan.
6. **Managing Event Types**: I can create new types of events with specific time lengths and descriptions for quicker scheduling in the future.

If you need help with any of the above tasks or anything similar related to event management, feel free to ask!
